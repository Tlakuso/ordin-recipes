        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The origins of the dish is a bit murky but it is thought that it originated in the townships of Johannesburg around the gold mines where mineworkers would create a stew consisting of tinned produce and any fresh vegetables they could obtain with chili.
            This was eaten with pap. Today it is a very popular dish to accompany a braai (barbeque). It can be eaten cold as a salad or it can be heated.
            Spicy chakalaka is best served the day after making it to allow the ingredients to mingle and get to know each other.
